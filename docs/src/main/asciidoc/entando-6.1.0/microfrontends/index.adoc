= Microfrontends

== Introduction

[quote, 'Michael Geers, https://micro-frontends.org/[micro-frontends.org]']

The idea behind Micro Frontends is to think about a website or web app as *a composition of features* which are owned by *independent teams*. Each team has a *distinct area of business* or *mission* it cares about and specialises in. A team is *cross functional* and develops its features *end-to-end*, from database to user interface.

So, think of microfrontends as the implementation of microservices concept to a full web app, UI included.

The Entando way to microfrontends is based on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components[Web Components], a set of technologies that allow developers to create reusable custom elements supported by all major internet browsers.

Web Components can work with vanilla JS as well as with the most popular web frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).

That means the Entando platform enables developers work with their favourite tech stack, and allows companies to quickly evolve their technology and to always look for best tech talents no matter the framework they use.

The following tutorials will help you creating Entando Widgets using a microfrontend-based approach.
