# Entando Solution Templates 

The Entando Application Composition Platform offers several Solution Templates to demonstrate various business capabilities and integrations. Each Open Source Solution Template was built with Entando and can be used as-is, reviewed for common development practices, or considered a useful starting point for a related application. 

The following Solution Templates and other sets of components are available in the [public Entando Hub](hub.entando.com) for installation in a user environment, where turnkey functionality can be customized and extended.
