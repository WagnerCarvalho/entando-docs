## Solution Templates

Each Solution Template enables and streamlines certain processes such as tasks and analysis. A template provides the building blocks and structure scoped for a particular implementation. Users are encouraged to leverage the existing frameworks and customize key functionality. 

Specific features and use cases are highlighted below:

- The Entando Customer Portal

- The [Entando Hub](../hub.md)

- The [Entando Process Driven Applications Plugin](../pda-tutorial.md) automates the management and completion of business processes via:

  - A flexible, general purpose UX layer created from custom micro rontends (MFEs)
  - A Spring Boot Backend for Frontend (BFF) microservice interface to inject underlying processes and toolkits
  - Communication with the [Red Hat Process Automation Manager](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/process-automation-manager) (PAM) to augment resources and mechanisms

- The [Entando Standard Banking Demo](../install-standard-demo.md)
