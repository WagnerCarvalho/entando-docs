# Entando Solution Templates 

## Overview

The Entando Application Composition Platform offers four Solution Templates to demonstrate various business capabilities and integrations. Each Solution Template provisions the building blocks and structure scoped for a particular implementation. 

Solution Templates are available in the [public Entando Hub](http://hubdev.okd-entando.org/entando-de-app/en/test.page#/) for installation in a user environment, where turnkey functionality can be customized and extended.
