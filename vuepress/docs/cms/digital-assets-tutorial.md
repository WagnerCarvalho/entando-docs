-   The image file that you just uploaded is displayed in the list; a
    statistical overview of the number of the uploaded resources (images
    and documents) is provided. The App Builderâ€™s interface allows the
    users to choose grid and list view; most of the time, users prefer
    to use list view when they are searching with specific requirements,
    while they love grid view for exploring. For every resource, image,
    or document, the list shows the following information:

    -   **Preview**

    -   **Name**

    -   **Type**

    -   **Uploaded By**

    -   **Uploaded At**

    -   **Group**

    -   **Categories**

    -   **Actions**

Furthermore, the interface lets you perform all management actions, as:

-   **Edit:** update the information data related to every single
    resource (image and document)

-   **Duplicate:** copy identically the resource from the original

-   **Download:** transfer the resource in your local machine

-   **Delete:** remove the resource
