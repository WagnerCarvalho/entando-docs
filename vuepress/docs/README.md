# Entando Platform

Entando is a **micro frontend platform for Kubernetes** that helps enterprises innovate faster with parallel development teams that have end-to-end autonomy across the entire stack.

With native support for Javascript app development, a micro frontend and microservices architecture, deployment of apps in containers that can be individually scaled up and down, and automated management of containers with Kubernetes, we simplify the move for enterprises looking to modernize across on-prem and cloud infrastructures.

## Why Kubernetes?

Instead of you doing the work to ensure your apps and services stay up and running, Kubernetes does the work for you. For each app or service, you can set resource limits, the number of pods you want backing each service, upgrade strategy, and auto-scaling. Kubernetes actively manages your cluster to match your defined resource utilization and ensures your site doesn't go down.

::: tip How Google Runs Containers in Production
Each week, Google deploys over 2 billion containers in production to run all of its services like Gmail, YouTube, and Search. Kubernetes is Google's open source solution to automate the management of containers at scale.
